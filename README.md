# Hola Mundo!
I'm Jesse, a web designer, developer and instructor based in San Antonio, Texas 

### Inside The Bubble 
When building, I focus on web standards, developer tools, and industry best practices. 
This approach enables me to create easily manageable online experiences that are inclusive, responsive, performant, user-friendly and accessible 

### What's In The Box 
Tools are just tools. They don't really matter—especially to the people trying to use the websites you build. 
The same goes for frameworks too. The most important thing is that you stick to the key principles <br /> **— Andy Bell** 

### Life In The Bubble 
Some of the best work i've ever done has been in the bubble.
It's a place where we can be ourselves, connect with others, and create great work for everyone
