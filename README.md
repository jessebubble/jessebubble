# Hola Mundo!
I'm Jesse, a web designer, developer and instructor based in San Antonio, Texas 

### Inside The Bubble 
I specialize in building online experiences that are inclusive, performant, user-friendly, and accessible to all.
By focusing on these principles, I aim to create a web experience that is welcoming, efficient, easy to use, and available to everyone

### What's In The Box 
Tools are just tools. They don't really matter—especially to the people trying to use the websites you build. 
The same goes for frameworks too. The most important thing is that you stick to the key principles <br /> **— Andy Bell** 

### Life In The Bubble 
Some of the best work i've ever done has been in the bubble.
It's a place where we can be ourselves, connect with others, and create great work for everyone
