Hey, I'm a web developer with strong interpersonal and communication skills, I'm excited to leverage my skills as part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team. Through a combination of bootcamps, self-learning and freelance work at VIVA Web Design, I've honed my skills in creating seamless and dynamic front-end interfaces that cater to the user's needs. In addition to my expertise in front-end development, I also have experience automating infrastructure updates using a git workflow and CI/CD tools.
