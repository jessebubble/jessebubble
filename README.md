### Did we just become best friends!?! 😀

I bring the following to every project:
- Problem-solving skills and perseverance
- Dedication to teamwork and flexible collaboration
- Foundational knowledge of agile software development principles
- Basic understanding of UX/UI principles

Holds a Full Stack Web Development certificate from the University of Texas, San Antonio where I developed skills in `ReactJS`, `MongoDB`, `NodeJS/ExpressJS`, `CSS`, `responsive web design`, and more

Current focus is on mobile-first design and learning more about iOS development with SwiftUI 📱 ⌚ 💻

I’m excited to leverage my skills as part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team. Let’s connect! 🌐
